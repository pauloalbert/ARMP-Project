We took our balancing code which seemed to work well from yesterday, the synchronized path following which also showed correct behavior, and combined them.

It was important to have the path following code continue, even when we didn't get a camera feed.

We found that the PID controller has several parameters we don't configure, like the delta_time parameter, and output_limits.
We researched what the delta_time entails, but eventually decided not to change it. we did however limit the outputs to prevent extreme cases where the robot flips out.

* We noticed the robot tends to drop the ball (literally) when moving from one path segment to the next.
We considered applying some correction or slowdown  between paths.
Alternatively, spline paths!
